# FinEdge
I developed a single-page website for a fictitious fintech startup called "FinEdge." Please note that this startup is not related to any real-world company named FinEdge.
FinEdge is a cutting-edge fintech startup dedicated to revolutionizing cross-border payments. Their vision is to enable seamless transactions for individuals and businesses, transcending geographical boundaries.

I developed this website by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, ensuring responsiveness and interactivity.Testing is conducted for compatibility, functionality, and user experience.
